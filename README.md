# TEXT_GENERATION_UISNG_HUGGINGFACE_LANGCHAIN
Hugging Face offers models like BERT and GPT for text generation. LangChain allows building applications with large language models by chaining components. Together, they enable efficient text generation workflows.
# Text Generation Project

This project utilizes Hugging Face and LangChain repositories for advanced text generation.

## Overview

- **Hugging Face**: Provides models like BERT and GPT for tasks such as text generation and summarization.
- **LangChain**: Enables building applications with large language models by chaining components like prompts and parsers.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-generation-project.git
    cd text-generation-project
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Load a Hugging Face model**:
    ```python
    from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

    model_name = "gpt2"
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    ```

2. **Generate text using LangChain**:
    ```python
    from langchain import TextGenerator

    text_gen = TextGenerator(model, tokenizer)
    prompt = "Once upon a time"
    generated_text = text_gen.generate(prompt)
    print(generated_text)
    ```
